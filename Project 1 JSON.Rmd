# Let's put the Joy in JSON!

# What packages "pack" the most punch for loading JSON

Reviewing CRANs documentation and list of packages for importing JSON formatted data, the package most frequently used based on the number of versions released and number of downloads is [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html). Outlined in the [quick start vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html) the function `fromJSON` was created to read in data. This function has a sereies of [variables](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/jsonlite/versions/1.6/topics/toJSON%2C%20fromJSON) to customize the input process and format the data when pulling the data from the web into a R object.
